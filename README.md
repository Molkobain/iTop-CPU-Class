iTop extension - add a CPU class, and affects it to the 'Server' class

This is one of my extensions to the incredible iTop tool. It's also my first contact with git, beware...

iTop give only one text field to describe the CPU type for a server. this was a little short for me.
I added that class permitting the description of a CPU, and then the assignement of this CPU to a server. It is also possible to create a new CPU type on the fly from the server view.
Version 1.1.0 adds a view of the servers using one specific CPU.
So I use the legacy CPU field as a num field, only to enumerate the number of CPUs.
